# Build System
As easy as it is to use SDx GUI, it is recommended to use provided cmake scripts to run synthesis and build the binaries for both the selected FPGA platform and the host.

# Dependencies
This project relies on these software/libraries(These should be installed on the OS):
```
Xilinx SDAccel 2019.1(Tested), 2018.3 2018.2 2017.4(Not Tested)
Xilinx XRT
python3(Symlinked as `python3`)
CMake3 (>3.10, Do **not** use default CMake package available on AWS-F1)
Bash (>4.0, Dash and others are not tested)
devtoolset-7 (>7.0, For C++14 support)
```
* Make sure that the latest vivado patches are applied, such as `AR73068`.

# Configuration
To make it easier to explore the design space and try different configurations, all of the parameters that affect the output performance of the task kernels are gathered in a separate submodule repository at directory `config`.
Also please note that various vivado directives for different steps are used to facilitate design implementation (opt, place, and route).

# 1. Building The Host Program
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
For CentOS 7.x, enable devtoolset-7 for C++14 support with:
```
scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
```
and continue with:
```
cmake ..
make DeepPointV2FPGA
```
In order to automate the building modes, an script for PasteBin has been developed to automatically upload the log files generated by XOCC during the compilation and the linking processes to PasteBin.com. Just make sure that it is enabled in the main CMakeLists.txt and username, password, and API key of your PasteBin account are set.  
The linking process requires a large amount of free memory(~30GB of ram for 8 parallel jobs) and close to 5GBs of disk space which takes almost 14 hours to complete with a `i7-6700HQ` machine.

# 2. Compiling FPGA Kernels
Considering that step one is already done and current directory is `build`. This step generates `*.xo` files needed for the linking process.  
For SW-Emulation:
```
make compile_swemu
```
For HW-Emulation:
```
make compile_hwemu
```
For HW(system build for real FPGA):
```
make compile_hw
```

# 3. Linking FPGA Kernels
Considering that steps one and two are already done and current directory is `build`. This step generates requested `*.xclbin` file needed for the host program.  
For SW-Emulation:
```
make link_swemu
```
For HW-Emulation:
```
make link_hwemu
```
For HW(system build for real FPGA):
```
make link_hw
```

# 4. Automated Build
The autobuild scripts are intended to make building process on an AWS instance easier. They compile and link the project consecutively and take log of each step in a text file. Finally, after finishing up, the instance would be powered off with the `sudo poweroff` command. (considering that the root user has no password)  
For SW-Emulation:
```
bash autobuild_swemu
```
For HW-Emulation:
```
bash autobuild_hwemu
```
For HW(system build for real FPGA):
```
bash autobuild_hw
```


# 5. Launching The Host Program
Considering that steps one, two and three are already done, current directory is `build` and the default shell is `bash`. This command is the unified solution to launch the host program in `sw-emu`, `hw-emu` or `hw` modes.
```
sh LaunchDeepPointV2FPGA.sh
```
The launcher script forwards its arguments to the host program.

## Platforms
Refer to the table below.

Name | Supported Platform | Implementation | Notes
---  | ---                | --- | ---
NYI | NYI         | NYI | NYI


## Tests
There are two types of tests for the project, `KernelTests` and `OclTests`. 

### Kernel Tests
`KernelTests` are located at `test/kerneltests` and mainly aim for testing the HLS code of the kernels.
To run the kernel tests, run:
```
make test
```

### Ocl Tests
These tests use Google Test Framework to test the correctness of the kernel outputs in HW-EMU and HW modes along with testing all the OpenCL related infrastructure of the DeepPointFPGA.
The main executable of `OclTests` is located at `test/ocltests/`. To execute the OclTests run this at the build directory:
```
sh LaunchOclTests.sh
``` 

# 6. AWS F1 Deployment
Please refer to `AWS-F1-Wiki.md`.

# 7. Project Structure
## Branches
This repository contains multiple branches as described below:

Branch | AXI Width | DType | Tool | Notes
---  |  --- |  --- |  --- |  ---
master | 512-bits | float32 | SDx2019.1 | -

# 8. Useful Tips
## TCL scripts
There are two TCL scripts named `PreRoute.tcl` and `PostRoute.tcl`. 
- The pre-route script is reponsible for generating the placed design `Pre_route_checkpoint.dcp` file.
- The post-route script generates SLR and per-block utilization and power estimation reports along with the routed design `Post_route_checkpoint.dcp` file.

Please note that Vivado could be used to open the design checkpoint files (`*.dcp`) to further explore the design implementation space. Open Vivado and choose `File: Checkpoint: Open` menu to import the desired checkpoint file.

The power estimation reports are generated in two formats (`*.txt` and `*.rpx`). The interactive report file (`*.rpx`) could be opened using the following Vivado TCL command: `open_report -file <path to *.rpx> -name myreport`.

## Debugging Host-side in CLion
In order to debug the host-side program in any modes(`sw_emu`, `hw_emu`, or `system`), CLion or any other C++ IDE could be used.

Remember to run `scripts/DbgScriptBinDir.sh` or `scripts/DbgScriptOclTestDir` before starting debugging session for the main executable or the OclTests' main executable. Note that class `XilinxImplementation` is configured to select `sw_emu` in the case that variable `XCL_EMULATION_MODE` was not set beforehand.  

## Launching Vivado HLS
It is possible to launch Vivado HLS GUI and optimize the kernel of choice. This could be done after running a `hw_emu` build:
```
cd _x/task_<KERNEL>_solution/task_<KERNEL>
vivado_hls -p task_<KERNEL>
```
* Please note that any changes to the source files will be reflected on the main repository files.
